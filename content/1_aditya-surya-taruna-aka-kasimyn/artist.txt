Maindescription: In *JOGET-X (A Speculative Archive of Alternate Histories of Indonesian Dance Music)*, Aditya Surya Taruna explores the diversity of Gamelan music to construct a speculative archive of Indonesian dance music. The project asks; what if colonisation did not affect how music, technology and dance has developed?

Extradescription:

Gamelan, made up predominantly of percussive instruments, is the traditional ensemble music of the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese peoples of Indonesia. Exploring the oral traditions and knowledge systems of indigenous culture, the work investigates how these knowledge systems can coexist with and contextualise global understandings of technology and music. The archive contains historical data from 1990 to 2030. Existing histories are hacked and deconstructed in collaborations with six musicians and dancers from Jakarta to Wamena (West Papua), through the process of Laras, an Indonesian tuning method. The artist is developing a set of open source digital instruments that are built with the methods and processes of Gamelan music. This method recreates traditional dance music free from the influences by chromatic/western scales. Kasymin speculates that this new method of music creation will affect the development of modern dance and club culture. Since beginning, the project has grown from six to over thirty musicians, intrigued by the idea of Decolonizing music using a primal Indonesian system with common contemporary tools. Joining forces with YES NO WAVE the results will be released in the compilation *JOGET-X : The Anthology of Indonesian Dance Music That (Should/Never) Exist*.

**Aditya Surya Taruna aka Kasimyn** is an electronic music producer, sound artist, DJ, amateur researcher, and graphic motion artist based in Bali. His work is inspired by points of crossover between tradition and technology, as well as dance music and the fascinating connection between the past and future of Indonesian culture. His experimental collaboration with fellow artist/MC Gabber Modus Operandi makes an imaginary Indonesian version of rave by using traditional scales with hardcore dance music. He has also worked solo as Hulubalang. He has appeared at festivals including Dark Mof, CTM Festival, Unsound, and NYEGE-NYEGE Festival Uganda, and has released on labels including YESNOWAVE Indonesia, Shanghai’s SVBKVLT, Ireland’s CANVAS INDEX, SFX Berlin, and the Swiss label DANSE NOIRE.
