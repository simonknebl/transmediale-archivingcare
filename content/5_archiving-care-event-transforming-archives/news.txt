***What Stays – Archiving Care***
Discussion
Akademie der Künste, Pariser Platz
 
How and what a society remembers has become a key question at a time when self-perceptions are being re-negotiated and mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion are being questioned. This shows in a new presence of the archive in contemporary art. The artistic memory work positions itself against current examples of historical oblivion and a disturbing surge of revisionism through the strengthening of nationalistic and racist historical narratives. At the same time, it argues in favour of long-overdue strategies for decolonising and diversifying bodies of knowledge and ranges of experience. The memory of humanity, analogous to the memory of nature itself, becomes a question that is crucial for survival. Cultural diversity as a resource of social and sustainable living has become a fundamental issue for shaping the future. This makes accumulated memory institutions and archives the focus of critical reflection as well. As a manifestation of power, they are called into question in their production of a canon.

The event was hosted by the (link: https://junge-akademie.adk.de/en/ text: JUNGE AKADEMIE) as part of the year-long programme of What Stays – Archiving Care, a collaborative project between transmediale, the JUNGE AKADEMIE of Akademie der Künste, Berlin and the Goethe-Institut Slovakia.
