Maindescription: *Noticing The Preconditions For \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\.* is an experiment in durational correspondence between artists Romi Ron Morrison and Mimi Ọnụọha. In this project, noticing takes an archival form, as an index of passing moments of care each artist notices in their daily lives.

----

Extradescription:

As every moment is indexed, a short media artwork (sound, video, photography) is created to represent these moments of care. This artwork is indexed in the archive and shared between Morrison and Ọnụọha to interpret, iterate, and resend the modified artwork back to the sender. These moments are intended to act as instructions that reveal Black futures in quotidian practices of care and kinship. This first iteration of the work exhibits a small sampling of the artworks created, as the artists will further develop their database with plans for a future physical installation.
